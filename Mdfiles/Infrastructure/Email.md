##Email

###1. Configure Email Settings:

<p>

Ensure that you have configured the email settings in your Django project's settings file, including SMTP server details.

</p>


```
# settings.py
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'your_smtp_server'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_email@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_email_password'

MAIL_ENCRPT_KEY = bytes(conf('MAIL_ENCRPT_KEY'), 'utf-8')
MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME = conf('MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME')
EMAIL_USE_SSL = True
# EMAIL_AUTO_LINK_KEY = b'iE_tQLb6FHPeuqmKeys'
# PASSWORD_OFFSET = 24
# PASSWORD_EXPIRY_OFFSET = 60


```

<p>
Adjust the settings according to your email provider.

That's a basic overview of using email templates in Django. Adjust the code based on your specific requirements and configurations.

</p>

###2. Send the Email
<p>
Use the send_mail function to send the email.
</p>

```
from django.core.mail import send_mail

def send_email(request):
    recipient_email = "john.doe@example.com"
    subject = "Subject of your email"
    message = render_to_string('your_app/email_template.html', {'recipient_name': recipient_name})

    send_mail(subject, message, 'your_email@example.com', [recipient_email])
```

<p>
Make sure to replace 'your_app' with the name of your Django app and 'your_email@example.com' with the email address you want to use as the sender.
