# Integration Layer

## 2FA

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide two forms of identification before granting access to an account or system. Typically, these factors fall into three categories: something you know (like a password), something you have (like a mobile device), and something you are (like a fingerprint).
